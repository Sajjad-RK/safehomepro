# Publication: Enhancement of The Fire Detection Devices' Functionality For The Prediction of Fire Possibility Via Machine Learning Algorithms
## International Conference on New Research and Technologies in Electrical Engineering (ICNRTEE)

The device we have presented is in the form of a connected network of smoke and dangerous gas detection devices centered on a single device that forms the Master-Slave architecture, and the sub-nodes of this network are primarily responsible for collecting the dataset of the entire building environment and the main node (master) uses this dataset and machine learning algorithms to investigate the possibility of fire.
